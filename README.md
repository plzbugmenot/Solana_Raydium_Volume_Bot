# Solana Volume Bot V3

This bot is designed to automate the distribution of SOL to multiple wallets and execute endless buy and sell swap transactions simultaneously on the Raydium and Meteora platform. It leverages Solana's blockchain technology to perform these operations efficiently.
And add feature to boost volume in Marketplace.

### What is the main difference between the former volume booster and the updated one?

## 🔧 Last Version's Demerits
- ❌ **Repetitive buy and sell with one wallet**: The last version of the Raydium Volume Bot used fixed wallets, so it was apparent on DexScreener that some wallets performed repetitive buy and sell actions.
- ❌ **No increase in the number of holders**: It didn't increase the number of holders, only the volume.
- ❌ **Gathering token instead of SOL**: When gathering, if there were tokens left, it didn't sell them before gathering. Instead, it just gathered tokens to the main wallet.
- ❌ **Equal number of buys and sells**: One-time buy and one-time sell actions left sell pressure at the end, as there was always a sell at the end of the volume operation.

## 🚀 Improvements
- ✅ **Transferring SOL to new wallet**: After buying and selling in one wallet, it transfers SOL to a newly created wallet and continues buying and selling there.
- ✅ **Holder increase**: New wallets are created every round of buying and selling, increasing the number of holders.
- ✅ **Sell before gather**: When gathering, if there are tokens left in the wallet, it sells the tokens first and gathers only SOL (the token account rent of 0.00203 SOL is reclaimed).
- ✅ **More buys than sells**: It randomly buys twice with SOL in the wallet and sells all tokens after some time, making the number of buys twice as many as sells, thus creating more buy pressure.

## 🌟 Features
